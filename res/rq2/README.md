## Data Explanation

File effectiveness.csv shows the original data in the Table 4. We manually check the
patch generated by ContractFix and summarize the number of 
successful/failed patches.

File transaction-replay.csv contains the original data shown in 
the Table 5. For each vulnerability category, we collect transaction data
for the top 5 contracts and compare the execution result of the
original contract and the patched contract.

For more detailed explanation of these data, please check the Section 5.3.
