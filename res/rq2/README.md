## Data Explanation
File change_of_line.csv contains the original data of the Figure 12 in our paper. These data
summarize the line of code changed by ContractFix.\

File effectiveness.csv shows the original data in the Table 2. We manually check the
patch generated by ContractFix and summarize the number of 
successful/failed patches.\

File transaction-replay.csv contains the original data shown in 
the Table 3. For each vulnerability category, we collect transaction data
for the top 5 contracts and compare the execution result of the
original contract and the patched contract.\

For more detailed explanation of these data, please check the Section 5.3.
